# Horibyte Arctic32

Arctic...but it 32-bit (real)

This is the virtual development laboratory for developing and debugging the 32-bit version of **Horibyte Arctic Server**.

Only correctly runs within VMware, to make it load `osload.bin`, create a new Virtual Machine and leave everything untouched, but make the VM type "Other", then add a Floppy drive and use the compiled .img file.

If you want to debug this, use GDB & QEMU

# THIS IS NOT AN STABLE RELEASE.
